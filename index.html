              <h1>Cyber Security</h1>
              <p>Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It encompasses a range of measures and techniques designed to safeguard digital information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical resources.</p>

              <p>In today's interconnected world, where technology is deeply integrated into our daily lives, cybersecurity has become a crucial aspect of both individual and organizational security. Cyber threats can come in various forms, including malware, viruses, ransomware, phishing attacks, social engineering, data breaches, and more. These threats can target individuals, businesses, governments, and even critical infrastructure, posing significant risks to privacy, financial stability, and national security.</p>

              <h1>Ethical Hacking</h1>
              <p>Ethical hacking, also known as white-hat hacking or penetration testing, refers to the practice of deliberately and legally exploiting computer systems, networks, or applications to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in order to improve their security. Ethical hackers, often employed by organizations or hired as independent professionals, use their technical skills and knowledge to uncover potential security flaws before malicious hackers can exploit them.</p>

              <p>The primary objective of ethical hacking is to assess the security posture of a system or network by simulating real-world attack scenarios. By actively seeking vulnerabilities and weaknesses, ethical hackers can help organizations identify and address security issues, mitigate risks, and enhance their overall cybersecurity defenses. Ethical hacking follows a structured and authorized approach, and its activities are carried out with the consent and cooperation of the system owners.</p>

            <h1>Internet Of Things</h1>
            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that refers to the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity capabilities, allowing them to collect and exchange data over the internet. These objects can be everyday devices, such as household appliances, vehicles, wearable devices, industrial machinery, or even infrastructure like smart buildings and cities.</p>
            <p>The main idea behind the IoT is to enable these objects to communicate with each other and with the internet, creating an interconnected ecosystem where data can be gathered, analyzed, and utilized for various purposes. By integrating physical objects with digital systems, the IoT opens up opportunities for automation, remote monitoring, data-driven decision-making, and new services.</p>
